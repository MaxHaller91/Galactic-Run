## Implementation Notes 📝

### Priority Guidelines
1. **Enhance Existing Systems First** - Build on current foundation
2. **Player Impact Focus** - Prioritize features that affect player interaction
3. **Emergent Behavior** - Simple rules that create complex interactions
4. **Performance Awareness** - Browser limitations guide technical choices

### Development Philosophy
> "Emergent gameplay comes from player choices and consequences, not from complicated systems. Simple rules that create meaningful interactions between players will naturally evolve into sophisticated economic warfare, political intrigue, and collaborative storytelling."

The complexity will emerge naturally from player creativity and interaction, requiring minimal technical overhead while generating infinite gameplay possibilities.
